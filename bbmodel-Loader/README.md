# bbmodel Loader
A project that can load models in the .bbmodel format in roblox, allowing the use of models created in block bench.

## Features
- Building the model
- Texturing the model
- rigging the model
- playing animations

## Known Problems
- Some models fail to be textured due to buffer issues
- some models get partly textured
- when playing animations repeatedly the model slowly moves up

## Limitations
- Due to engine limitations, meshes cannot be made and textured with editable images.
